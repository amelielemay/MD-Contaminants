angle_style harmonic	#angle-bend interactions are harmonic
dihedral_style opls		#dihedral (torsion) interactions are in the OPLS format
improper_style harmonic

special_bonds lj/coul 0.0 0.0 0.5	#This tells LAMMPS to ignore LJ and Coulomb interactions between atoms that are connected through a bond or an angle and scale them by half for atoms that are connected through a dihedral (default for the OPLS force field)

fix 1 all momentum 10000 linear 1 1 1 angular	#every 10000 steps, LAMMPS calculates the velocity of the center of mass and adjusts all atomic velocities so that the center 													#of mass isn’t drifting
