#Glyoxal input file

units metal 			#defines the units (lengths in A, time in ps, energy in eV, pressure in bar, …)
dimension 3 			#the simulation cell is three-dimensional
atom_style full			#atoms are defined by their partial charge + xyz coordinates
pair_style lj/cut/coul/long 12.0	#LJ + Coulomb interactions; short-range cutoff at 12 A; long-range Coulomb treated in reciprocal space
bond_style harmonic		#bond-stretch interactions are harmonic
angle_style harmonic	#angle-bend interactions are harmonic
dihedral_style opls		#dihedral (torsion) interactions are in the OPLS format
improper_style harmonic
pair_modify mix geometric		#geometric mixing rule for interactions between unlike atoms (this is the convention for the OPLS force field)

special_bonds lj/coul 0.0 0.0 0.5	#This tells LAMMPS to ignore LJ and Coulomb interactions between atoms that are connected through a bond or an angle and scale them by half for atoms that are connected through a dihedral (default for the OPLS force field)

kspace_style pppm 0.001		#long-range Coulomb (beyond 15 A) solved with the PPPM algorithm with 99.9 % precision

timestep 0.0001				#timestep equals 0.1 fs (production runs typically use 1 fs, but it is sometimes useful to start the pre-equilibration with a shorter time-step)
run_style verlet			#equations of motion solved with the Verlet algorithm (this is pretty standard)

thermo_style one			#one of the stardard styles for the thermodynamic output that LAMMPS reports during the run
thermo 1000					#thermo output will be reported every 1000 steps

dump 1 all dcd 100 Glyoxal_01.dcd		#LAMMPS will write trajectory data every 100 steps to a dump file in dcd format
dump 2 all xyz 1000000 Glyoxal_01.xyz	#LAMMPS will write the initial structure to a dump file in xyz format
dump_modify 2 element C O H	#dump 2 is modified so the atoms are called C O H instead of 1 2 3

fix 1 all momentum 10000 linear 1 1 1 angular	#every 10000 steps, LAMMPS calculates the velocity of the center of mass and adjusts all atomic velocities so that the center 													#of mass isn’t drifting

fix 2 all nvt temp 298.0 298.0 0.1			#equations of motion solved for all atoms in the NVT ensemble at 298 K, with a thermostat coupling constant of 0.1 ps (relatively 												#tight coupling; for production runs I usually relax this to 1 ps)
